# Contributing
FredBoat is built using Gradle, so you should just be able to import the project in your favorite IDE and download all dependencies while building. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/issues) to find out what needs to be done.

When submitting a pull request, please submit against the `development` branch, or you will have to reopen your PR. 

## Code conventions
Code is indented with 4 spaces and without brackets on newlines. Please use the logging system (SLF4J) instead of `System.out` or `System.err`.

It is a good practice to make use of the default code formatter of your IDE to adhere to existing conventions of the project. However, please do not reformat any lines that you aren't actually changing.

This project makes use of additional annotations to improve quality and cleanliness of the code, most notably `javax.annotation.Nonnull` & `javax.annotation.Nullable` for parameters and return values of methods. Please use these to describe the contracts of any methods you are adding. Feel invited to add these when you spot missing ones in the existing code base.

## Issue labels
* **Beginner** Means that the issue should be suitable for new contributors.
* **Intermediate** Means that the issue might be somewhat more difficult.
* **Advanced** Means that the could be a major feature or requires a deep understanding of the bot.
* **Docs** Means that help is wanted to improve the documentation.

These 4 tags all imply that help is wanted, so feel free to contribute at whichever level. Please announce your intention to work on something so we don't accidentally try to write the same changes!

Also feel free to work on your own ideas. Especially commands, we can't have too many of those.

## Writing a Command

The easiest way to write a new command for FredBoat from scratch is by having a look at how similar commands are written.
A few core concepts are used by almost every command:

### Extending
A FredBoat command must extend the abstract class [Command.java](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/FredBoat/src/main/java/fredboat/commandmeta/abs/Command.java) and implement the the methods of the [ICommand](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/FredBoat/src/main/java/fredboat/commandmeta/abs/ICommand.java) interface.

### Permissions
FredBoat runs its own, simplified permission system that takes care of properly interacting with the user. Existing permission levels are defined in [PermissionLevel.java](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/FredBoat/src/main/java/fredboat/perms/PermissionLevel.java), and by implementing [ICommandRestricted.java](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/FredBoat/src/main/java/fredboat/commandmeta/abs/ICommandRestricted.java) you gain access to a method to provide the minimum required permissions for your command.

### Context
Each command is provided a `CommandContext` during execution. This context provides access to the invoker, guild, textchannel, message, parsed arguments etc. Further more it provides convenience methods to reply to users.

### Help
Each command is required to provide a proper help string explaining all possible usages and arguments. If your command gets too complex for that, adding an additional page to the official documentation (example: [Permissions commands](https://fredboat.com/docs/permissions) may be discussed.

Commands intended for public use (read: non-admin, non-maintenance commands) are required to support translation.

### Translations
See [Translations](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations) for more details on our flow of adding new strings to translation files.
You can access translations through any provided `Context`.

### Example: The Shuffle Command

The [ShuffleCommand.java](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/blob/master/FredBoat/src/main/java/fredboat/command/music/control/ShuffleCommand.java) makes use of permissions by implementing `ICommandRestricted` and overriding `getMinimumPerms()` to return a DJ level, making this command only executable by users with the DJ level or higher. It uses the `CommandContext` to know which guild the command is run in and access that guild's player. Being a public command, it uses translated strings in its replies and its help.

```java
public class ShuffleCommand extends Command implements IMusicCommand, ICommandRestricted {

    public ShuffleCommand(String name, String... aliases) {
        super(name, aliases);
    }

    @Override
    public void onInvoke(@Nonnull CommandContext context) {
        GuildPlayer player = PlayerRegistry.getOrCreate(context.guild);
        player.setShuffle(!player.isShuffle());

        if (player.isShuffle()) {
            context.reply(context.i18n("shuffleOn"));
        } else {
            context.reply(context.i18n("shuffleOff"));
        }
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public String help(@Nonnull Context context) {
        return "{0}{1}\n#" + context.i18n("helpShuffleCommand");
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public PermissionLevel getMinimumPerms() {
        return PermissionLevel.DJ;
    }
}
```
To be fully usable, the command is registered in one of the CommandInitializers with its name and aliases:
```java
MusicCommandInitializer.java
        [...]
        CommandRegistry.registerCommand(new ShuffleCommand("shuffle", "sh", "random"));
        [...]
```

## Translations

If you want to fix existing translations, you are welcome to contribute over at [FredBoat's Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/fredboat).

To include new translation strings, add them to the `en_US.properties` file that you can find in the `resources/lang` folder. A collaborator will take care of regularly syncing and updating the other translation files through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/fredboat).

### Rules for translations
- present tense, imperative verbs
- group strings topically, for example help strings belong next to each other in the file
- keep formatting characters (\_ \* \` etc) out of the translations files, they should be added by the code instead
- don't overuse variables, as those make it harder to write good translations


## Setting up your IDE

Obtaining a well functioning and productive setup of the IDE may be an intimidating process, especially for users new to coding or the Java world. Here are some tips that will hopefully make this step a bit easier.

### Running the bot

Add `credentials.yaml` and `config.yaml` files to the FredBoat root directory.

To run the FredBoat bot in IntelliJ IDEA, find the little green play button in the main class `FredBoat.java` and start it from there:

Alternatively you can set up a gradle task to run or debug FredBoat:

[![Running with gradle in IDEA](https://fred.moe/iPb.png)](https://fred.moe/iPb.png)

This also allows you to take advantage of Java hotswapping, which you can enable in IDEA like so:

Reloading while the bot is running will have your changes hot swapped, so there is no need to fully restart it each time when you are rapidly testing out a lot of small changes.

### Automating tasks

Reformatting your code, organizing imports, recompiling, etc are tasks that you may end up running _a lot_ each day.

A convenient time to do them is when saving files, so you might want to [create a macro](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-macros-in-the-editor.html) that does all the housekeeping for you and put it on the CTRL + S hotkey, or use a plugin like [Save Actions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions).

Here is a decent configuration:
