/**
 * Created by napster on 04.10.17.
 * <p>
 * This class rate limits all Discord logins properly.
 * This means it needs to take care of the following sources of (re)connects:
 * <p>
 * - JDAs reconnects (may happen anytime, especially feared during start up)
 * - Reviving a shard (either by watchdog or admin command) (may happen anytime though they are rather rare)
 * - Creating a shard (happens only during start time)
 * <p>
 * This class achieves its goal by implementing a token like system of coins, which need to be requested before doing
 * any login (reviving or creating shards). In case JDA queues reconnects, those get immediate priority over our own
 * logins. The coin system will wait until the JDA reconnect queue is done and only then issue new login coins.
