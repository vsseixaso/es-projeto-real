/**
 * Created by napster on 17.04.17.
 * <p>
 * This class uses an algorithm based on leaky bucket, but is optimized, mainly we work around having tons of threads for
 * each bucket filling/emptying it, instead saving timestamps. As a result this class works better for shorter time
 * periods, as the amount of timestamps to hold decreases.
 * some calculations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Afdn25AsFD-v3WQGp56rfVwO1y2d105IQk3dtfTcKwA/edit#gid=0
